      "description": "We've made a few changes to the Logic Editor. Please make sure to make a backup of your entire .sketchware folder before you try this beta out! There might be bugs in the editor, and they could corrupt your projects. Please check in the Issues section (https://github.com/Sketchware-Pro/Sketchware-Pro/issues) before you report any.\n\nHighlighted features:\n - Java 1.9, 10, and 11 compile support! This only works in minApi26 builds though. Thanks to @PranavPurwar for the contribution!\n - Syntax highlighting for Kotlin and even XML files.\n - When Sketchware Pro crashes, you can now send the error message to us. It's fully optional though, so please make sure to send them if you want to help us fix bugs!\n - New features using root access: Auto-installing of projects, and also launching of projects if auto-install is enabled and worked.\n - You can now use e.g. `tools:replace=\\\"android:id\\\"` in a View's inject property to remove `android:id` from its XML code. This is a replacement for XML Command Blocks that change tiny things like these.\n\nOther new features/improvements:\n - New instructions on setting a custom return type when creating a new More Block.\n - Kotlinc updated to v1.7.10\n - Improved confirmation dialog when about to delete all attributes of an Activity in AndroidManifest Manager.\n - Upgrades to r8 v3.3.75.\n - More build progress when exporting a project.\n - Kotlin files in Java/Kotlin Manager now have an icon.\n - Projects can now be exported and then signed using testkey.\n\nFixes:\n - Projects using e.g. the Google Maps library work again.\n - Projects don't crash anymore due to SketchLogger if debug logging is enabled.\n - Adding new AdMob ad unit IDs works again.\n - FragmentAdapter Components can be used in Fragment Activities too now.\n - The Logcat Reader button in Developer Tools now actually works.\n\nFull Changelog: https://github.com/Sketchware-Pro/Sketchware-Pro/compare/v6.4.0-rc04...v6.4.0-rc05",
